Therefore, using data to identify risk factors for heart disease is crucial. This dataset focuses on Japanese citizens, recording their health status, risk factors, and personal conditions to explore potential insights within the data.\n\n### 1.2 Objective\n\nThis take-home exercise aims to apply appropriate **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** methods and **ggplot2** functions to analyze the data. Based on the analysis and observations, it also briefly suggests potential insights for future research to help policymakers improve public healthcare.\n\n## 2 Data prepare\n\n### 2.1 Install and launch R packages\n\n| Package | function |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| ggplot2 | For data visualization, creating high-quality charts. |\n| dplyr | For data manipulation, providing efficient filtering, transformation, and summarization functions. |\n| scales | For adjusting scales, axes, and formatting in ggplot2 charts. |\n| tidyverse | A collection of data science packages, for data processing and visualization. |\n| ggridges | For creating ridge plots, useful for visualizing density distributions. |\n| colorspace | For advanced color management, including color transformations and palette selection. |\n| plotly | For creating interactive charts, including 3D and dynamic visualizations. |\n| crosstalk | For enabling interactive data sharing between different HTML widgets (e.g., plotly, DT tables). |\n| DT | For creating interactive HTML data tables. |\n| ggdist | For statistical visualizations, such as distributions and uncertainty representations. |\n| gganimate | For animating ggplot2 charts, enabling time-series or dynamic visualizations. |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggplot2, dplyr, scales, tidyverse, ggridges, colorspace, plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.2 Data source\n\nThe dataset comes from Kaggle, with 1 table, 32 columns, and 30,000 rows. Each row of data represents the basic physical condition of a Japanese citizen.\n\n### 2.2.1 Importing Data\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_attack_data <- read.csv(\"data/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Checking for duplicates\n\nCheck the data set for duplicate data to prevent interference with subsequent analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_attack_data[duplicated(heart_attack_data), ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] Age                     Gender                  Region                 \n [4] Smoking_History         Diabetes_History        Hypertension_History   \n [7] Cholesterol_Level       Physical_Activity       Diet_Quality           \n[10] Alcohol_Consumption     Stress_Levels           BMI                    \n[13] Heart_Rate              Systolic_BP             Diastolic_BP           \n[16] Family_History          Heart_Attack_Occurrence Extra_Column_1         \n[19] Extra_Column_2          Extra_Column_3          Extra_Column_4         \n[22] Extra_Column_5          Extra_Column_6          Extra_Column_7         \n[25] Extra_Column_8          Extra_Column_9          Extra_Column_10        \n[28] Extra_Column_11         Extra_Column_12         Extra_Column_13        \n[31] Extra_Column_14         Extra_Column_15        \n<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe result shows no duplicate data.\n\n### 2.2.3 Select relevant variables\n\nAccording to Fabian Sanchis-Gomar. (2016). *Epidemiology of coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome.* This analysis will focus on the following factors:\n\n| No | Name | Description | Type of Variable |\n|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|\n| 1 | Age | Age of respondents | Numerical |\n| 2 | Gender | Male or Female | Categorical |\n| 3 | Smoking History | Yes or No | Categorical |\n| 4 | Diabetes History | Yes or No | Categorical |\n| 5 | Physical Activity | Intensity level of physical activity | Numerical |\n| 6 | Cholesterol_Level | Cholesterol levels of respondents | Numerical |\n| 7 | Stress Level | Stress Level of respondents | Numerical |\n| 8 | BMI | Weight / Height ², used to determine the weight health status of respondents | Numerical |\n| 9 | Family History | Yes or No | Categorical |\n| 10 | Heart Attack Occurrence | Yes or No | Categorical |\n\nTherefore, only relevant columns are selected for analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect_data <- heart_attack_data %>% select (Age, Gender, Smoking_History, Diabetes_History, Physical_Activity, Cholesterol_Level, Stress_Levels, BMI, Family_History, Heart_Attack_Occurrence )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nUse the code to perform checks on the newly generated dataset.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(select_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 10\n$ Age                     <int> 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  <chr> \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"F…\n$ Smoking_History         <chr> \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Y…\n$ Diabetes_History        <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Physical_Activity       <chr> \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", …\n$ Cholesterol_Level       <dbl> 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Stress_Levels           <dbl> 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     <dbl> 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Family_History          <chr> \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\"…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.2.4 Check missing values\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nany(is.na(select_data))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe result shows no missing values.\n\n## 3 Insights\n\n### 3.1 Relationship between age and heart disease\n\nSince the number of respondents in each age group is not necessarily the same (i.e., the age distribution is not necessarily balanced), it is also necessary to consider the age distribution of the respondents.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(select_data, aes(x = Age)) +\n  geom_histogram(data = select_data, aes(x = Age), binwidth = 5, fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_histogram(data = subset(select_data, Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\"), aes(x = Age), binwidth = 5, fill = \"tomato\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Age Distribution for All People and Heart Attack Patients\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n| Insight 1 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| As we can see from the graph above, there is no significant relationship between whether or not a person has heart disease and their age in Japan. The distribution of the number of people with heart disease does not change significantly with age, and the number of people with heart disease is basically the same as the age distribution of the respondents. |\n\n### 3.2 Relationship between gender and heart disease\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scales)\ndata_summary <- select_data %>%\n  group_by(Heart_Attack_Occurrence, Gender) %>%\n  summarise(count = n()) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(total_count = sum(count), percentage = count / total_count)\n\nggplot(data_summary, aes(x = \"\", y = count, fill = interaction(Heart_Attack_Occurrence, Gender))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Heart Attack Occurrence vs Gender\", fill = \"Heart Attack Occurrence and Gender\") +\n  theme_void() +  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"lightcoral\", \"salmon\", \"lightsteelblue\", \"skyblue\")) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = percent(percentage)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = \"black\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n| Insight 2 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| From the above figure, we can see that the proportion of men and women with heart disease is almost the same when the ratio of men and women respondents is almost the same, so it can be seen that whether or not to suffer from heart disease has nothing to do with the gender of the patients in Japan. |\n\n### 3.3 Heart Disease in relation to Diabetes, Smoking, and Family History\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_exercise_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_prop <- select_data %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Diabetes_History, Smoking_History, Family_History),\n               names_to = \"Risk_Factor\",\n               values_to = \"Status\") %>%\n  group_by(Risk_Factor, Status) %>%\n  summarise(Heart_Attack_Rate = mean(Heart_Attack_Occurrence == \"Yes\")) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(df_prop, aes(x = Status, y = Heart_Attack_Rate, fill = Status)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Risk_Factor) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Heart Attack Occurrence by Risk Factors\",\n       x = \"Risk Factor Status (Yes/No)\",\n       y = \"Heart Attack Occurrence Rate\",\n       fill = \"Risk Factor Status\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +  #

Based on the above results, I make the following speculation:\n\n1.  The form of the dataset may be not suitable for analyzing heart disease\n2.  The Japanese have a low incidence of cardiovascular disease worldwide, and their healthy lifestyle may make the role of these potentially heart disease-causing variables less pronounced\n3.  Given the complexity of the causative factors of heart disease, it may not be possible to analyze the relationship of only one pair of variables to derive valid insights, so subsequent logistic regression models or decision trees may be used to further analyze the dataset and incorporate additional medical information to determine the weight of these potential causative factors.\n\n## References\n\n<https://atm.amegroups.org/article/view/10896/11530>\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaychoudhary/heart-attack-in-japan-youth-vs-adult>\n",
